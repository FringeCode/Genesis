# Genesis
This repository allows me to share my process and progress through exploring C++, graphics programming, and software development as a whole. Thanks for visiting, I hope you find your time here beneficial.

At this time, having just begun this project, I intend for Genesis to provide you and every other user with an application with which to visually and/or audially experience my realized conjurations of various scenes, environments, scientific phenomena, concepts and their models, and other forms of media. This repository thus contains the source code that defines and is used to build the Genesis application. One goal I have for Genesis is to allow for the customization of included experiences and the import of your own items, perhaps as a form of multimedia player and scene editor; for the source code, to provide reusable and useful constructs such that you may use this work as a library to support your own creativity and programming ventures is also a goal of mine.

Best wishes,
Fringe

## Updates
**2025.5.23** - Inspired to explore C++ compilers beyond my current experience and most recent stint with MSVC and Visual Studio 2022. Today marks the birth of Genesis and its first commit.**

## Upcoming
This section itself will be written into with my plans and ideas for Genesis and the code and resources necessary to craft a featureful, enjoyable, and satisfactory experience. As of now, main.cpp holds a TODO list with my initial thoughts.
